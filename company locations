# Data Science Job Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze job market trends for data science roles using a dataset of job postings. The goal is to extract insights on salaries, required skills, job locations, and industry demands.

## Dataset
The dataset (data_science_job.csv) contains job listings with various attributes such as job title, company, location, salary, and required skills. This data will be used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## Project Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends in data science job postings.
- **Skill Analysis:** Identify the most in-demand skills for data science roles.
- **Salary Insights:** Analyze salary distributions across different job titles and locations.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Understand job availability by region.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **CSV Data Handling**
